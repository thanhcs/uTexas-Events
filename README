CS 378 - Fall 2015 - Beta Release

First thing to run the app:

uncomment the line 24 in EventTableViewController to add sample data to Core Data (addData())
comment it after the first time run the app

Contributions:

Holt - Due to a late start and being out of town I wasn't able to contribute much to the Beta release. I have talked with my group and it is understood that I will be doing a larger than normal portion for the Final Build.

Justin Baiko:
search functionality to event,category,host tab
datepicker for date,to and from time for adding events
email functionality for event and host tabs

Thanh Nguyen:
I changed change the idea of Data Model to directly use Core Data in the app
I created most the things in the app except what Justin did.

There are some bug:

- when click the search bar without canceling it, then go to the another tab, going back will cause the back screen.
- When do the search, then click one of the result, the action will slow because the table view of the search result will have to be dismissed first before go to the next view.

Features to be in the final:

- Log in
- RSVP


Differences:

We still follow the idea which we had at the beginning. We change tags to category.

We don't have back end, so some features we list like Chat room / comments section we can't add them to the app.'
