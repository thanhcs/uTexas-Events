CS 378 - Fall 2015 - Final release

This is the big improvement comparing to the beta release. We implemented app to make it have a back end server (Parse). We didn't intent to do this at the beginning. We only figured out we didn't have a partner doing the UI (he gave up a week before the final day), so we had to do our work including the UI.'
